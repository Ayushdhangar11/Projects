# RailGuard-AI

An AI system based on state-of-the-art object 
detection models including YOLOv8, YOLOv8s, YOLO-NAS 
for improving crowd control, automating trash detection, 
and real-time monitoring system for violence escalation. 
Furthermore, it also integrates theft control and predictive 
maintenance strategies to make better use of resources and 
time management. Thus, equipping railways with this system 
will help in creating better public amenities, improving the 
running of the operations, and ensuring safety, as the 
existing systems tend to have a lot of gaps.
